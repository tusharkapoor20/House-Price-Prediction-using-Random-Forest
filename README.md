# House Price Prediction with Random Forest Algorithm
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict house prices based on important features extracted from the dataset. Additionally, it calculates the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various features of houses, such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc., along with their corresponding prices.

## Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees. It's known for its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality.

## Implementation
random_forest_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for house price prediction.
housing.csv: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual house prices. A lower MAE indicates better predictive accuracy.

## Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open random_forest_regression.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells.
## Dependencies
Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
